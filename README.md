The Web site is about me, it has 4 pages, index.html, about.html, coding.html and contact.html.

The header and footer is the same in all pages. I am a begginer so i try to use all the elements and properties. I use a flexbox in index.html, a grid in about.html, bootstrap components and grid in coding.html, and a form in contact.html.

In file media.css there is the responsive media. There are also 4 .css files, one for each page.

Finally, there are two sass files with the respective their .css files. I use variables, nesting and inheritance.
