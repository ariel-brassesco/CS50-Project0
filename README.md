The Web site is about me, it has 4 pages, `index.html`, `about.html`, `coding.html` and `contact.html`.

The header and footer is the same in all pages. I am a begginer so I try to use all the elements and properties. I use a flexbox in `index.html`, a grid in `about.html`, bootstrap components and grid in `coding.html`, and a form in `contact.html`.

In folder images there are all the images files using.

In folder css there all the `.css` files. In file `media.css` there is the responsive media, also I put a @media in `about-style.scss`. There are also four `.css` files. The file `stylesheets.css` has general styles apllies to all pages, and `about-stylesheets.css`, `coding-stylesheets.css` and `contact-stylesheets.css` correspond to the page.

There are two sass files with the respective their .css files. I use variables, nesting and inheritance.

In the `.css` files, I use `.class` and `#id` selectors, also I use the selectors `element`,`element > element`, `element element`, `elemente[property='value']`, `element:hover`, `element:last-child`, `element::after`, `element:first-line` and `element::first-letter`.
